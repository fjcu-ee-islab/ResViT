## ResVIT environment

This paper uses Kuberun to establish the docker environment

Downloads [docker image](https://hub.docker.com/layers/moeaidb/aigo/cu11.1-dnn8.0.5-gpu-pytorch-20.12/images/sha256-d8e407d9e7c4d80434c2957de892f127761dee0be1406c79150f96ef3bdc14b1?context=explore)

Connection method:
Enter IP/KubeRun in the browser, and you can connect to the same network domain. After connecting, you will see the following screen.


login:
Click the login button on the upper right. After logging in, the screen is as follows.
Note: There are two types of KubeRun login identities, administrator and user. Here first log in as an administrator to make settings.

To create a general user, create steps:

To add a new user in the Ubuntu environment, use the command 

```sudo adduser $newuser```

Restart KubeRun to obtain the user UID GID and use the command 

```cd /var/KubernetesUI/ && sudo ./4_startDockerCompose.sh```

Add a new user, the screen is as follows. The account is the user added in step 1, the password can be set by yourself, and click Get UID
GID button.
MAX GPU In order to give the user the maximum number of GPUs that can be used at the same time, special attention is required. This UI GPU has
exclusive,
If the GPU is used by one user, it cannot be used by another user.
The Pending number is the upper limit of the number of concurrent schedules for this user.

### image:

image (image file) is similar to the master film of docker, one image can create many dockers for different tasks
Add or create docker images, here take pull moeaidb/aigo:cu11.1-dnn8.0.5-gpu-pytorch-cv-20.12 as an example, as follows.

The result after successful pull is as follows.

### Custom image:

To create a docker image that can be used by each user, you must first perform the above steps to create the user and obtain the docker image to be given to the user, as follows.


```
pip install einops
```
