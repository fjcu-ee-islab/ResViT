# ResViT

We propose the ResViT architecture to address the issue of insufficient training data in medical imaging.

We are the first to propose the staged and overall architecture algorithms and learning algorithms base on ViT framework.

We also conducted a heatmap analysis to check the black-box nature of the deep learning model in this paper, and found that the OCT images focus on different regions for different glaucoma diseases.
